# Hangman

Inspired by the talk titled "Prosta gra w JavaScripcie jako zadanie rekrutacyjne" which had been performed by Kasia IwaÅ„ska on Gamedev.js. I decided to create my own Hangman game as my first bigger project. 

My main goal was to practice OOP. User can use the displayed keyboard as well as keyboard of device. For every round there are three hints available.

This project is not done yet - making it more mobile-friendly application and adding some features for this game itself are my plans for the future.

Technologies in scope:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript (plain VaniliaJS)

You can try out this game under ->
