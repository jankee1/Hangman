# Hangman

Inspired by the talk titled "Prosta gra w JavaScripcie jako zadanie rekrutacyjne" which had been performed by Kasia IwaÅ„ska on Gamedev.js in Warsaw I decided to create my own Hangman game as my first bigger project. 

This project is not done yet - making it more mobile-friendly application and adding some features for this game itself are my plans for the future.

Technologies in scope:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript (plain VaniliaJS)

You can try out this game under ->
